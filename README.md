# Riddikulus - An API to Thematify Math Questions

To increase engagement and interest towards math word problems, this API makes a boring problem interesting
using a theme of your choice like Iron Man, Harry Potter, etc.

This is an API to serve the work of the paper [A Theme-Rewriting Approach for Generating Algebra Word Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06210) which also has an accompanying [repo](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/kedzior/Rewriter).

There is an accompanying [web app](https://github.com/13point5/Riddikulus-Web-App) that I have made to demonstrate this.

### Here's an example:

**Original Question**

> Alice has 2 apples and Bob has 3 apples. How many apples do they have?

**Iron Man version of the question**

> Stark has 2 olives and Jarvis has 3 olives . How many olives do they have ?
